Drop the roof and let the smoke clear
I got diamonds doin toosie slides in both ear
Dice rollin' on that Las Vegas strip tonight
Slip that in and we might miss the fight
Fuck a knot, I keep the guala in my shorty bag
You know she one of mine when she tattoo that ass
I'm a lover boy 
She love the toys
Keep it comin', you a rider
